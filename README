sndiokeys registers hot-keys in X to control sndiod(8) server.
The default key bindings are as follows:

Control+Mod1+plus	decrease output level
Control+Mod1+minus	increase output level
Control+Mod1+0		cycle through audio devices

Mod1 is the Alt key on most keyboards. Key bindings
are configurable and multimedia audio keys may be used instead.
