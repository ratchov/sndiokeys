sndiokeys registers hot-keys in X to control sndiod(8) server.
The default key bindings are as follows:

Control+Mod1+plus	decrease output level
Control+Mod1+minus	increase output level
Control+Mod1+0		cycle through audio devices

Mod1 is the Alt key on most keyboards. Key bindings
are configurable and multimedia audio keys may be used instead.

sndiokeys can be used to replace the X(7) keyboard bells by audible
beeps on the audio device.

sndiokeys is meant to be started as background process by startx(1) or
the display manager session startup scripts.  It exits when X session
terminates.
