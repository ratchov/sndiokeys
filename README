sndiokeys - control sndiod with hot-keys and play keyboard bells

sndiokeys registers hot-keys in X(7) to control sndiod(8). It can be
used to replace the X(7) keyboard bells by audible beeps on the
audio device.

The default key-bindings are as follows:

Control+Mod1+plus	increase output level
Control+Mod1+minus	decrease output level
Control+Mod1+0		cycle through audio devices.

Mod1 is the Alt key on most keyboards. Key bindings
are configurable and multimedia audio keys may be used instead.

sndiokeys is meant to be started as background process by startx(1) or
the display manager session startup scripts.  It exits when X session
terminates.
