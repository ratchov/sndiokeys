# sndiokeys - control sndiod with hot-keys

sndiokeys registers hot-keys in X(7) to control sndiod(8). It can also
replace the X(7) keyboard bell by a beep on the audio device.

Key bindings are configurable.

sndiokeys is meant to be started as a background process by startx(1) or
the display manager session startup scripts.
