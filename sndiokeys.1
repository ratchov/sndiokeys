.Sh NAME
.Nm sndiokeys
.Nd
control sndiod with hot-keys and play keyboard bells
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sndiokeys
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl b Ar [mod+...]key:func
.Op Fl D
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
registers hot-keys in
.Xr X 7
to control
.Xr sndiod 8 .
It can be used to replace the
.Xr X 7
keyboard bells by audible beeps on the audio device.
.Pp
The default key-bindings are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "Control+Mod1+minus" -offset indent -compact
.It Control+Mod1+plus
increase output level
.It Control+Mod1+minus
decrease output level
.It Control+Mod1+0
cycle through audio devices.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is meant to be started as background process by
.Xr startx 1
or the display manager session startup scripts.
It exits when X session terminates.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Play audible beeps on the audio device in place of the
.Xr X 7
keyboard bells.
.It Fl b Ar [modifier+...]key:function
Perform
.Cm function
whenever
.Cm key
is pressed while
.Cm modifier
keys are held down.
Key names correspond to symbols defined in
.Pa /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h
with the
.Cm XK_
prefix removed.
Supported modifiers are: Control, Mod1, and Mod4.
On most setups, Mod1 and Mod4 correspond to the Alt and Windows keys.
Function names are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "cycle_dev" -offset indent -compact
.It inc_level
increase output level
.It dec_level
decrease output level
.It cycle_dev
cycle through audio devices
.El
.It Fl D
Daemonize.
.It Fl f Ar device
Audio device to control.
.It Fl s
Don't emit audible beep when output level or audio device are changed.
.It Fl v
Increase log verbosity.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Increase or decrease output level when Up or Down keys are pressed
while the Control and Mod1 keys are held down:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sndiokeys -b Control+Mod1+Up:inc_level \\
            -b Control+Mod1+Down:dec_level
.Ed
.Pp
Make volume keys found on multimedia keyboards control the output level:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ sndiokeys -b XF86_AudioRaiseVolume:inc_level \\
            -b XF86_AudioLowerVolume:dec_level
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sndioctl 1 ,
.Xr startx 1 ,
.Xr sndio 7 ,
.Xr X 7 ,
.Xr sndiod 8
.Sh BUGS
Volume keys of multimedia keyboards may already control output level
using another mechanism.
If so, using the same keys in
.Nm
may cause unpredictable output level changes.
